The NICE **Call Recordings** screen requires the NICE Inform recording
system, including the NICE Inform codec\'s, and user account credentials
which are configured in the [NICE Interface configuration
screen](NICE%20Interface%20Settings.htm).  It is opened from either the
[Premier Responder Supervisor](911Adviser%20Supervisor.htm) main window
with the **Tools - Call Recordings** menu item or from the [Case
Reports](Case%20Reports.htm) screen using the **Recordings** toolbar
button.

# Searching for Recordings

When opened from the **Case Reports** screen, the from and to dates are
automatically set to the start and end time of the indicated call,
otherwise they are set to search the current day\'s recordings.
Resources available for searching appear in the **Resource** drop down
list on the toolbar.

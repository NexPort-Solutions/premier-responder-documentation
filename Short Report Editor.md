  **Short Report Editor**
  -------------------------

The **Short Report Editor** is used to construct a dynamically generated
report.   Included in the report are pre-determined entries from the
[General Questions](General Questions.md).  These are inserted into
the static content of the report when it is generated.  The short report
appears on the [Short Report tab](Short Report.md) of the active call
window and is also sent to [CAD](911Adviser Acronyms.md) upon receipt
of the [Get Short Report API command (op code39)](APCO 911Adviser API.md).

To access the Short Report Editor:

-   Log into [Premier Responder    Administrator](911Adviser Administrator.md) as Administrator
-   From the **Premier Responder Administrator** window select
    **Edit-Call Type** menu item.
-   The **Short Report Editor** lies within the bordered area labeled
    **Short Report** on the **Call Types** sub tab of the [Call Type    Editor](Available Call Types Editor.md).

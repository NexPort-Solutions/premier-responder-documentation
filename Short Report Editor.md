  **Short Report Editor**
  -------------------------

The **Short Report Editor** is used to construct a dynamically generated
report.   Included in the report are pre-determined entries from the
[General Questions](General%20Questions.htm).  These are inserted into
the static content of the report when it is generated.  The short report
appears on the [Short Report tab](Short%20Report.htm) of the active call
window and is also sent to [CAD](911Adviser%20Acronyms.htm) upon receipt
of the [Get Short Report API command (op code
39)](APCO%20911Adviser%20API.htm).

To access the Short Report Editor:

-   Log into [Premier Responder
    Administrator](911Adviser%20Administrator.htm) as Administrator
-   From the **Premier Responder Administrator** window select
    **Edit-Call Type** menu item.
-   The **Short Report Editor** lies within the bordered area labeled
    **Short Report** on the **Call Types** sub tab of the [Call Type
    Editor](Available%20Call%20Types%20Editor.htm).

changes.  To exit the **Short Report Editor** click on the **Close

### **Software Deactivation**

## Deactivate Licensing Menu

A **Deactivate Licensing** menu option is available from within the**Help** menu of each application.  The menu is enabled when logged on\
as an administrator and the software has been activated.  It allows for\
activations to be transferred from machines that are to be\
decommissioned to replacement machines.  Within the **Deactivate**\
**Licensing** menu are submenu options for deactivating directly or\
indirectly.  Use the direct method when internet access is available on\
the host machine and the indirect method when not.

to be made by the call-taker on the **Pre-Arrival** tab.  To change the
label or hide the tab use the **Tab #5** settings on the [Guide Card
Tabs configuration screen](Guide%20Card%20Tabs%20Settings.htm).  The
pre-arrival instructions are entered on the **Pre-Arrival** tab of the
[Guide Card Editor](Guide%20Card%20Editor.htm).

# Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can appear in the pre-arrival instructions and are indicated
by a blue underlined font.  The mouse cursor is seen as a hand with the
index finger pointing upward when hovering over a link  When clicked on,
a link performs an action such as opening a scripted procedure window or
changing the chief complaint.  Once clicked on, links appear with a
blue, bold, underlined font.

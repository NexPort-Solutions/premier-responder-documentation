  **Available Guide Card Editor**

[Available Guide Cards Form]{.underline}

Each Premier Responder guide card identifies a specific complaint.  The
**Available Guide Cards** editor is used to manage the guide cards or
complaints.  Optionally, codes may be assigned to a guide card.  This
allows the CAD to set the complaint for an active call remotely using
one of the assigned codes.  To open the **Available Guide Cards**
editor, log into **Premier Responder Administrator** and select the
**Edit** / **Guide Cards.**

The **Call Type** drop down on the **Available Guide Cards** window is
used to select the call type.  Complaints for the selected call type are
shown in the **Guide Cards** list.  The **New**, **Delete**, **Up**, and
**Down** buttons at the top of the window are used to manage the
complaint entries.  When an entry is selected in the **Guide Cards**
list, its assigned codes are shown in the **Complaint Codes** list.  The
buttons above the **Complaint Codes** list are used to manage the code
entries.  Tool tips are available to identify the graphically labeled
buttons.  By holding the mouse pointer over the button, a text
description will appear.

[Managing Guide Cards]{.underline}

The procedures that follow describe the guide card management functions
performed in the **Available Guide Cards** editor.

To add a guide card:

-   Specify the call type by making a selection in the **Call Type**
    drop down list.
-   Select the **New** toolbar button at the top of the tab.  *New Guide
    Card* is added to the bottom of the **Guide Cards** list and is
    automatically selected for editing.  Note that unless the call type
    includes a [Guide Card style general
    question](General%20Questions%20Editor.htm), the **New** button
    remains disabled.
-   Edit the guide card name in the **Name** text box.  Note that the
    maximum length of the guide card name is 100 characters even though
    the text box will accept more.  An entry of more than 100 characters
    is truncated.
-   Use the **Section** drop down list to assign a color to the guide
    card.  The guide cards appear in the [complaint drop down list on
    the active call window](General%20Questions.htm) with the assigned
    background color.  When created, the **Section** entry defaults to
    white.

[Complaint Codes]{.underline}

CAD can use the codes to remotely get and set the complaint.  These
codes can optionally appear in the [Chief
Complaint](General%20Questions.htm) drop down by enabling the
**Complaint Code Prefix** setting on the [Call-Taking Component
configuration screen](Call-Taking%20Component%20Settings.htm). 
Additionally, with the **Include Problem Codes** setting checked on the
[CAD Interface configuration screen](Cad%20Interface%20Settings.htm),
the codes associated with the selected complaint are returned to CAD.

    **Guide Cards** list.

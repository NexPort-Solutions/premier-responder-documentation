### **Available Guide Card Editor**

## Available Guide Cards Form

Each Premier Responder guide card identifies a specific complaint.  The**Available Guide Cards** editor is used to manage the guide cards or\
complaints.  Optionally, codes may be assigned to a guide card.  This\
allows the CAD to set the complaint for an active call remotely using\
one of the assigned codes.  To open the **Available Guide Cards**\
editor, log into **Premier Responder Administrator** and select the**Edit** / **Guide Cards.**

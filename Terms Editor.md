# Terms Editor Window

The Terms Editor is used to enter the terms and abbreviations that
appear in the [Terms window](<Medical Terms.md>).  To open the Terms
Editor select the **Edit - Terms** menu item on the **Premier Responder
Administrator** window.  The Terms Editor opens with the terms for the
current call type loaded.  Make another selection from the **Call Type**
drop down to see terms for the other call types.  The **New**, **Save**,
and **Delete** menu buttons are disabled for [call types whose contentis protected](<Available Call Types Editor.md>).  Use the **Close
Editor** button to close the Terms Editor.

# Terminologies

Existing terminology categories for the selected call type are listed in
the **Terminology** drop down.  When a term is selected on either the
**Abbreviations** or **Glossary** tabs, the category it belongs to is
indicated in the **Terminology** box.  To move a term to another
existing category, make a different selection from the **Terminology**
drop down and then select the **Save** menu button.  A term can be moved
into a new category by entering a new name in the **Terminology** box
and selecting the **Save** menu button.

### **Email Alerts**

## Introduction

**Email Alerts** is a part of the Premier Responder Supervisor module.&#x20;\
Its purpose is to continuously monitor Premier Responder calls for\
occurrences of predefined events, hereafter known as alerts, and to send\
out notifications via email once an alert is triggered.  To start, login\
to Premier Responder Supervisor and click the **Tools-Email Alerts**\
menu item.

## Getting Started

When starting for the first time, the Email Alerts status indicates\
"Alert Monitoring Disabled".  Software configuration is covered in the\
online help subjects entitled "[Locating Premier ResponderData](Data%20Setup.md)" and "[Email ConfigurationSettings](<Email Setup.md>)".  Once the software is configured, alerts\
can be created and then monitored.  The [AlertEditor](<Alert Editor.md>) subject in the help explains how alerts are\
added.  With the software configured and alerts entered, monitoring of\
the alerts will begin as soon as the editors are locked by going to**Edit -> Enable Alert Monitoring** and supplying a locking password.&#x20;\
Refer to the [Alert Monitor](<Alert Monitor.md>) subject in the help\
for more on how monitoring works.

## Security

A security feature has been provided to protect configuration settings\
and alerts from being modified.  To access the feature select the**Edit/Lock** menu item on the main form.  This brings up the **Lock**\
**Alert Editor** dialog window.

Enter the same password in two text boxes then select the **OK** button\
to activate the security feature.  This hides the [AlertEditor](<Alert Editor.md>), [Email Setup](<Email Setup.md>), and [DataSetup](Data%20Setup.md) tabs and the **File/Open** menu item,\
preventing the current configuration from being changed.

To deactivate the security feature, select the **Edit/Unlock** menu item\
on the main form.  The **Unlock Alert Editor** dialog window is\
displayed.  Type in the previously entered password and select the OK\
button to deactivate the security feature.  The hidden tabs and menu\
items on the main form will again appear.

Premier Responder is a Windows™ software application designed to guide
telecommunicators through the process of managing emergency calls. 
Using customized medical guide card information, Premier Responder
enables the call receiving operator (CRO) to make informed decisions as
to what units to dispatch to the scene of an emergency while also
providing pre-arrival instructions to assist the caller until emergency
responders arrive.

Included within Premier Responder are online references for viewing
information on hazardous materials, medical terms and abbreviations, and
common medical procedures.  This information can be called up at any
time during or between calls via easily accessible controls on the main
form.

Premier Responder can be configured to store the information gathered
over the course of a call either to the local workstation or to a common
archive located on a shared network drive.  The ability then exists to
query the archive for selected calls and browse through them
individually or to export the query results to Microsoft Excel where
statistical charts can be generated from the collective data.

Further customization of Premier Responder is made possible via editors
for entering contact information, standard operating procedures, and
guide card sets for law enforcement and fire type emergencies, all of
which can be accessed later through administrator and supervisor
modules.

There are three components that make up the Premier Responder
application, with each component being assigned a different area of
responsibility.  The three components together with their respective
area of responsibility are as follows:

-   [Premier Responder Call-Taker](Premier%20Responder%20Call-Taker.htm)
    for entering calls and accessing online references.
-   [Premier Responder Supervisor](Premier%20Responder%20Supervisor.htm)
    for QA and generating reports.
-   [Premier Responder
    Administrator](Premier%20Responder%20Administrator.htm) for data
    entry and configuration.

# Edit Priority Categories Tab

Priority categories represent the different levels of urgency used when
dispatching units to the scene of an emergency.  They are entered on the
**Priority Categories** edit screen of the administrator application and
subsequently appear on the [Priority tab](Priorities.htm) of the call
taker application active call window.  To access the **Priority
Categories** edit screen, select the **Edit** - **Call Types** menu item
on the Premier Responder Administrator main window after logging in. 
Note that editing is enabled for priority categories other than
medical.  Changes to the medical priority categories require the
approval of the local medical director.

# Removing A Category

To remove a category, select it in the **Select** listbox and then click
the **Delete** button.  It is the button with an image of a red X on the
face.  The category is immediately removed from the Select listbox.

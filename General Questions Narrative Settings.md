  **Universal Question Narrative Settings**
  -------------------------------------------

Selecting **Universal Question Narrative** from the **Configuration
Settings** list on the **Premier Responder Administrator - Settings**
tab displays the following settings:

-   **Narrative Disabled**: When selected, narratives are disabled (no
    notification of universal question entries are sent to CAD).
-   **Question + Entry**: When selected, both the question and entry are
    included in the narratives sent to CAD.
-   **Entry Only**: When selected, only the entry is included in the
    narratives sent to CAD.
-   **Job Text**: When selected, the [job
    text](General%20Questions%20Editor.htm) associated with the entry is
    placed in the narratives sent to CAD (for entries without associated
    job text, no notification of these entries are sent to CAD).
-   **Notify CAD when entries are cleared**: When checked, notifications
    are sent to CAD when a universal question entry is cleared (provided
    the narrative has not been disabled).

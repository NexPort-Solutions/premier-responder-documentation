## Premier Responder Call-taker Window

Prior to starting a case, the Premier Responder Calltaker main form\
appears as shown below.  It consists of a title bar, menu bar, tool bar,\
recent calls table, and a status bar.  The title bar, located at the top\
of the form, and the status bar, located at the bottom of the form, both\
display information pertaining to the current state and user of the\
Premier Responder Calltaker application. Underneath the title bar is the\
menu bar.  Logging in and out, contacts, home, and help contents are all\
accessed through the menu items on the menu bar.  Below the menu bar is\
the tool bar where the controls for those functions, that require quick\
access are located. These functions include starting a call, viewing a\
case, refreshing the case list, and pre-selecting a call type.

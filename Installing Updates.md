The Premier Responder software is installed on individual machines.&#x20;\
Installation is a two part process consisting of installing the software\
followed by the data files.  After the initial installation, updates to\
the software and data files may be installed to remote machines on the\
network from a primary workstation via the update software and data\
screens found in the administrator application.  Remote installation of\
software and data file updates is covered in the following topics:

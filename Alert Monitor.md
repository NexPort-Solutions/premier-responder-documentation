# Alert Monitor

***

### **Alert Monitor**

The **Alert Monitor** tab lists all of the alerts along with their\
status.  Alerts are polled every 10 seconds by default, or they are\
polled by the value specified in the "Time interval for monitoring"\
numeric control in the "Email Setup" tab.  When an alert is being\
polled, its font style is changed to italic.  The number of occurrences\
of each named event is displayed in the **# Hits** column.  If the the\
number of occurrences reaches the alert's **Limit**, then the alert\
becomes active and an email message is sent out to the specified\
addresses.  An active alert is indicated by a red background.

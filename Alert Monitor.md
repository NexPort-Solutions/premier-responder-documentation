  **Alert Monitor**
  -------------------

The **Alert Monitor** tab lists all of the alerts along with their
status.  Alerts are polled every 10 seconds by default, or they are
polled by the value specified in the \"Time interval for monitoring\"
numeric control in the \"Email Setup\" tab.  When an alert is being
polled, its font style is changed to italic.  The number of occurrences
of each named event is displayed in the **\# Hits** column.  If the the
number of occurrences reaches the alert\'s **Limit**, then the alert
becomes active and an email message is sent out to the specified
addresses.  An active alert is indicated by a red background.

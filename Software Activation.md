### **Software Activation**

## Activation Dialog

When purchasing the software, a license with a fixed number of\
activations is issued.  Until the software has been activated using the\
license credentials, the first window to appear after launch of any of\
the applications will be the **Premier Responder Activation** dialog\
window.  Internet access is required to activate the software.  The\
activation dialog window includes options for activating directly or\
indirectly, the method used being dependent on whether internet access\
is available on the host machine. A trial license is granted under which\
the software can be evaluated for a period of 30 days using the trial\
option.  Once the trial period  is expired the option is disabled.&#x20;\
Closing the dialog window without activating aborts the launch of the\
application.

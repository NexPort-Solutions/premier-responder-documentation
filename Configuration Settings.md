  **Configuration Settings**
  ----------------------------

In addition to supporting customized guide card content, the Premier
Responder software can be further tailored to meet a customer\'s
requirements using the configuration settings that are provided.  They
affect both the appearance and behavior of the software.  The
configuration settings are accessible via the **Settings** tab.  To
bring up the **Settings** tab log into Premier Responder Administrator
and select the **Configure -\> Settings** menu item.

# Settings Tab

The controls on the **Settings** tab are used to select a configuration,
select a settings category, change and save settings.  Available
configurations are shown in the **Configuration** drop down.  The
settings categories are shown in the **Configuration Settings** list. 
When a category is selected, its group of settings appear to the right.

# Selecting a Configuration

Premier Responder can store an indefinite number of configurations. 
Available configurations appear in the **Configuration** drop down
list.  The settings for the selected configuration are loaded when
Premier Responder starts.  To load settings for a different
configuration, select it from the drop down list.

# Creating and Deleting Configurations

To create a new configuration, enter a name for the configuration in the
**Configuration** box and then select the **New** button.  The name is
added to the drop down list and the configuration is created.  Creating
a new configuration does not affect existing configurations nor does it
change the configuration in use.  To delete a configuration, select it
from the drop down list and click the **Delete** button.

# Changing Settings

To change settings, select one of the setting categories in the
**Configuration Settings** list.  The controls for the category appear
to the right of the list.  Hover the mouse cursor over a setting to see
a description of the setting.  Use the setting controls to make the
desired change.

# Saving the Configuration

Changes to settings do not take effect until they are saved.  To save
changes select the **Save** button.  The current settings are saved to
the selected **Configuration** and then its settings are applied to
Premier Responder.  To exit the **Settings** tab without applying
changes, select the control box **X** at the top right of the tab.

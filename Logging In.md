The **Premier Responder User Login** dialog consists of a **Users**\
list, a **Password** text box, a **Log In** and a **Cancel** button.&#x20;\
When open, the other application windows are inaccessible.  To close the\
window without logging in select the **Cancel** button.

When Premier Responder is interfaced with a computer aided dispatch\
(CAD) system, CAD is able to log users in remotely.  Note that CAD users\
are not required to be added as a Premier Responder user in order to\
enter calls.

# Premier Responder Introduction

### **Premier Responder Introduction**

Premier Responder is a Windows™ software application that is used to\
assist a Call Receiving Operator (CRO) through the process of handling\
an emergency call.  Using customized medical guide card information\
prepared by and the local Medical Director, Premier Responder enables\
the call receiving operator to make informed decisions as to what units\
to dispatch to the scene of an emergency while also providing\
pre-arrival instructions to assist the caller until emergency responders\
arrive.

Premier Responder can be configured to store the information gathered\
over the course of a call either locally or to a common archive located\
on a shared network drive.  The ability then exists to browse through\
the data in the archive and print reports on individual cases or export\
selected cases to Microsoft Excel so that collective reports can be\
generated.

Included within Premier Responder are online references for hazardous\
materials, terms & abbreviations, and medical instructions.  These are\
accessible to the CRO through menu items on the active call window.

Finally, Premier Responder allows an agency the opportunity to further\
customize the software by providing the means to:

* Create guide card sets for other call types
* Enter terms & abbreviations, standard operating procedures, and  \
  contacts
* Enable optional features through configuration settings

the call-taker on the **Background** tab.  To change the label or hide
the tab, use the settings for **Tab #7** on the [Guide Card Tabs

# Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can appear in the background information and are indicated by
a blue underlined font.  The mouse cursor is seen as a hand with the
index finger pointing upward when hovering over a link  When clicked on,
a link performs an action such as opening a scripted procedure window or
changing the chief complaint.  Once clicked on, links appear with a
blue, bold, underlined font.

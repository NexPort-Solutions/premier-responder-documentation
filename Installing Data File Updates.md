[Update Data Screen]{.underline}

Data file updates in the form of a Windows Installer Package can be
installed to remote machines from the administrator Update Data screen. 
When receiving an update, first install it on the primary workstation
then launch and log into the administrator application.  Next, within
the administrator application, select the File - Update Data menu item.

When the Update Data screen first opens, a search is immediately started
for Premier Responder instances on the network.  The time it takes for
the search to complete varies, depending on the size of the network.  As
instances are located, entries are added to the Software Instances
list.  Each entry in the list includes the machine name, data file
version, and software in use (Yes or No).

Once the search completes, select the Change button to open a browser,
locate the installer, and set the path. Next check the boxes beside the
machines to be updated.  Machines showing the software in use cannot be
checked for updating.  With the installer path set and machines checked
to update, the Update button becomes enabled.

When all is ready, select the Update button to begin.  The update
process ends when the Result column of all checked machines indicates
\"Update Installed\".  To close the Update Data screen, select the X
(close) toolbar button.  The Refresh button clears the Software
Instances list and starts another search.

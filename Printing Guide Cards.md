  **Printing Guide Cards**
  --------------------------

# Print Tab

Guide card printing is accomplished on the **Print** tab of the Premier
Responder Administrator application.  To load the **Print** tab, log
into Premier Responder Administrator with an administrator access level
user ID then select the **File - Print** menu item.  The **Print** tab
consists of a toolbar at the top and a text area below where the guide
card content appears.  Located on the toolbar is a drop down list for
selecting the guide card set and buttons for saving, printing and
previewing the generated report. A tool tip appears when hovering the
mouse cursor over one of the buttons.

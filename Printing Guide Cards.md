  **Printing Guide Cards**
  --------------------------

# Print Tab

Guide card printing is accomplished on the **Print** tab of the Premier
Responder Administrator application.  To load the **Print** tab, log
into Premier Responder Administrator with an administrator access level
user ID then select the **File - Print** menu item.  The **Print** tab
consists of a toolbar at the top and a text area below where the guide
card content appears.  Located on the toolbar is a drop down list for
selecting the guide card set and buttons for saving, printing and
previewing the generated report. A tool tip appears when hovering the
mouse cursor over one of the buttons.

# Generate Report

The **Call Type** drop down is used to select a guide card set.  Once a
call type is selected, a progress bar appears at the bottom of the
window as guide cards are being loaded and again as pages are loaded. 
When loading completes the generated report appears in the text area of
the **Print** tab and the number of report pages is indicated on the
toolbar.  The report content consists of the all callers interrogation
with its part of the customized short report and then for each guide
card, sections containing the vital points, priorities, pre-arrival
instructions, call taker actions, dispatcher actions, background, and
short report.  Each section only appears when enabled and with the label
given on the [Guide Card Tabs
Settings](Guide%20Card%20Tabs%20Settings.htm) configuration screen.

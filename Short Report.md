the first part of the report.  It is constructed in the Short Report
area of the [Call Type Editor](Available%20Call%20Types%20Editor.htm). 
Key question entries appear in the second part of the report.  It is
constructed on the **Short Report** tab of the [Guide Card

the tab use the settings for **Tab #8** on the [Guide Card Tabs

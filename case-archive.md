# Case Archive

The Case Archive tab is used to configure Premier Responder to archive cases.  To open the "Case Archive" tab, first log into the Premier Responder Administrator.  Then select the Configure -> Archive menu item from the main window.

When a call is ended, the call information is saved to the working cases database on the computer running Premier Responder.  Archiving the case moves the case to an archive database which can be on the same computer or another computer.  Typically, several Premier Responder workstations will archive cases to a common database.  The Case Archive tab controls the archive features.

When the Enable Auto Archive checkbox is checked, cases are automatically sent to the archive database.  The archive database can be selected as either an Access, SQL Server, or Oracle database using the Archive Cases to Access database, Archive cases to SQL Server database, or Archive cases to Oracle database radio buttons. The Archive Path text box shows the path of the selected database.

When Enable Auto Archive is unchecked,  or when the connection to the archive fails (such as when the network is offline), the cases will be stored on the local machine.  These cases can later be sent to the archive database by enabling auto archive or automatically sent when the network comes back online.

As more positions conduct transactions on the cases archive the possibility for contention increases.  To lessen the effects of multiple processes vying for exclusive access to the archive, the Archive Query Timeout setting is provided for limiting the time of database queries and the Archive Max Retries setting for specifying the number attempts that can be made to complete a transaction.  Both settings have a range of 1 to 10 with Archive Query Timeout defaulting to 3 and a default of 5 for Archive Max Retries.

# NICE Recordings

***

### **NICE Recordings**

The NICE **Call Recordings** screen requires the NICE Inform recording\
system, including the NICE Inform codec's, and user account credentials\
which are configured in the [NICE Interface configurationscreen](<../../../../NICE Interface Settings.md>).  It is opened from either the[Premier Responder Supervisor](../../../../911Adviser%20Supervisor.md) main window\
with the **Tools - Call Recordings** menu item or from the [CaseReports](<../../../../Case Reports.md>) screen using the **Recordings** toolbar\
button.

## Searching for Recordings

When opened from the **Case Reports** screen, the from and to dates are\
automatically set to the start and end time of the indicated call,\
otherwise they are set to search the current day's recordings.\
Resources available for searching appear in the **Resource** drop down\
list on the toolbar.

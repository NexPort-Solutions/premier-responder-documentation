blue underlined font.  The mouse cursor is seen as a hand with the index\
finger pointing upward when hovering over a link  When clicked on, a\
link performs an action such as opening a scripted procedure window or\
changing the chief complaint.  Once clicked on, links appear with a\
blue, bold, underlined font.

# Email Setup

***

### **Email Setup**

The **Email Setup** tab contains controls for configuring the email\
server and the content of the email messages.  Within the **Email**\
**setup** frame, the **SMTP Host** is entered which is the name of the\
mail server that will receive email messages from **Email Alert**.  A**Return address** is required by SMTP servers to be included in\
outgoing messages. \*NOTE: **Email Alert** can not receive return\
messages.  The **Subject** box specifies the subject line of all email\
alert messages.  The **Message Header** specifies the first text that is\
in all email messages. User account credentials are entered in the**User ID** and **Password** fields for authentication purposes with the\
SMTP server.

The **Email test** frame's controls are used to send out a test email\
message using the **Email setup** settings.  Use the **Send test**\
**message** button to send the test email message to the **Test**\
**address**.  The test email message will contain "Test:" in the subject\
and "This is a test message" in the body of the message.

**Email message settings** contains more controls for the email\
messages.  Checking **Send update email for new alert event occurrence**\
will send a new email message when a new occurrence happens for a\
triggered alert.  **Time interval for monitoring** establishes how often\
Email Alerts checks to see if a criteria for an alert has been met. The\
content of all email messages can contain any of the ten items by\
checking the box next to the item to include such as **Case Number** and**Dispatcher**.

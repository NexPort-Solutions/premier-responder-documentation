  **Call-Taker Actions**
  ------------------------

The **Call-Taker Actions** tab contains instructions for the operator
taking the call that is associated with the specific emergency selected
in the [Universal Questions](General%20Questions.htm).  There are no
entries to be made by the call-taker on the **Call-Taker Actions** tab. 
To change the label or hide the tab use the settings for **Tab #4** on
the [Guide Card Tabs configuration
screen](Guide%20Card%20Tabs%20Settings.htm).  Call taker actions are
entered using the [Guide Card Editor](Guide%20Card%20Editor.htm).

# Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can appear in the call-taker actions and are indicated by a
blue underlined font.  The mouse cursor is seen as a hand with the index
finger pointing upward when hovering over a link  When clicked on, a
link performs an action such as opening a scripted procedure window or
changing the chief complaint.  Once clicked on, links appear with a
blue, bold, underlined font.

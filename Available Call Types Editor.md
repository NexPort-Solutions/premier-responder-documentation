Call types appear in the list on the left side of the window.  The
selected call type is highlighted.  Graphical buttons at the top of the
window are used to add, remove, and reorder the call types shown in the
list.  Tool tips can be seen when the mouse cursor is hovered over the
buttons for a short period of time.  Call type attributes are indicated
by the check boxes located at the bottom left of the window.

[Reordering Call Types List]{.underline}

The **Up** and **Down** buttons are used to change the order of call
types in the list.  This same order is also seen in the call type drop
down list of the [All Callers Questions](All%20Caller%20Questions.htm). 
When selected, the highlighted call type moves one position in the
indicated direction.

[Call Type Attributes]{.underline}

The name can be edited in the **Call Type** text box.  Note the **New**
and **Delete** buttons and the **Available**, **Protected**, and
**Permanent** check boxes are disabled.  To have call types added or
removed, please contact Smart Horizons.

[Saving Changes]{.underline}

Changes made in the **Call Types** window are not applied until the Save
button is selected.  Any changes that are not saved are discarded when
the **Call Type Editor** is closed.

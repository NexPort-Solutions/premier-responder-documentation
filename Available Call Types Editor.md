# Available Call Types Window

Premier Responder installs with three default call types, these being
fire, law enforcement, and medical.  The **Call Types** editor can be
used to add additional call types.  To open the **Call Types** editor,
select **Edit - Call Types** menu item on the **Premier Responder
Administrator** window.

# Reordering Call Types List

The **Up** and **Down** buttons are used to change the order of call
types in the list.  This same order is also seen in the call type drop
down list of the [All Callers Questions](All%20Caller%20Questions.htm). 
When selected, the highlighted call type moves one position in the
indicated direction.

# Call Type Attributes

The name can be edited in the **Call Type** text box.  Note the **New**
and **Delete** buttons and the **Available**, **Protected**, and
**Permanent** check boxes are disabled.  To have call types added or
removed, please contact Smart Horizons.

# Saving Changes

Changes made in the **Call Types** window are not applied until the Save
button is selected.  Any changes that are not saved are discarded when
the **Call Type Editor** is closed.

Selecting **Status Bar Panels** from the **Configuration Settings** list
on the **Settings** tab of the Premier Responder Administrator window
opens the **Status Bar Panel** configuration screen.  There are four
groups of settings seen on this screen.  The first three setting groups
pertain to the status bar at the bottom of the active call window, these
being for the [call timer](All%20Caller%20Questions.htm) in **Panel 1**,
the [dispatch priority](Priorities.htm) in **Panel 2**, and the [case
number](All%20Caller%20Questions.htm) in **Panel 3**.  The last group of
settings pertains to the user ID appearing in the status bar of the
[Premier Responder Administrator
window](911Adviser%20Administrator.htm), the [Premier Responder
Call-taker window](911Adviser%20Call-Taker.htm), and the [Premier
Responder Supervisor window](911Adviser%20Supervisor.htm).  Each panel
group includes the following settings:

-   **Enabled (Panels 1-4)**: When checked, panel appears on status bar.
-   **Min Width (Panels 1-4)**: Indicates minimum width of panel.

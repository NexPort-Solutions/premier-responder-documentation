# VPI Recordings

***

### **VPI Recordings**

The VPI **Call Recordings** screen requires the VPI Empower\
communications recording and quality improvement software and an\
authorization key or user account credentials which are configured in\
the [VPI Interface configurationscreen](<VPI Interface Settings.md>).  It is opened from either the[Premier Responder Supervisor](911Adviser%20Supervisor.md) main window\
with the **Tools - Call Recordings** menu item or from the [CaseReports](<Case Reports.md>) screen using the **Recordings** toolbar\
button.

## Searching for Recordings

When opened from the **Case Reports** screen, a search is automatically\
performed for recordings that were made during the time of the indicated\
call, otherwise a search is made for the current day's recordings. The\
number of rows returned by the search is set by the **Page Size** drop\
down selector located on the **Search Results** toolbar and appears in\
the far right status bar panel.

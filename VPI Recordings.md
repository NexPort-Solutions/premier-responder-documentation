  **VPI Recordings**
  --------------------

The VPI **Call Recordings** screen requires the VPI Empower
communications recording and quality improvement software and an
authorization key or user account credentials which are configured in
the [VPI Interface configuration
screen](VPI%20Interface%20Settings.htm).  It is opened from either the
[Premier Responder Supervisor](911Adviser%20Supervisor.htm) main window
with the **Tools - Call Recordings** menu item or from the [Case
Reports](Case%20Reports.htm) screen using the **Recordings** toolbar
button.

# Searching for Recordings

When opened from the **Case Reports** screen, a search is automatically
performed for recordings that were made during the time of the indicated
call, otherwise a search is made for the current day\'s recordings. The
number of rows returned by the search is set by the **Page Size** drop
down selector located on the **Search Results** toolbar and appears in
the far right status bar panel.

Use the **Search From** and **to** date/time controls on the main
toolbar to change the search parameters.  The search results are updated
automatically.  The not symbol seen on the **Radio** button indicates
that radio interactions are excluded from the results.  To include radio
interactions, select the **Radio** button so that an image of a radio
replaces the not symbol.  Use the numeric **Page** selector on the
**Search Results** toolbar to step through the pages or to enter a page
number when the number of rows exceeds the set page size.

# Playing Recordings

To play a recording, either click on the **Search Results** toolbar
**Open** button after having selected a row in the **Search Results**
list or double click on a row.  If not logged into VPortal, the default
web browser opens to the VPortal login screen.  Upon logging in to
VPortal, the VPI media player opens with the selected interaction.

### **Primary Questions**

## Primary Questions

The primary questions for the selected call type appear on the Universal\
Questions tab of the active call window and include those other than the\
name, location, phone, and call type.  Responses are made either by\
selecting an item from a drop down list or by entering text into the\
data field.  Note that the text to the left of the answer box can also\
contain hyperlinks.  Selecting a hyperlink performs an action such as\
opening a procedure window or changing the complaint selection.  The\
primary questions are created in the [Universal QuestionsEditor](<General Questions Editor.md>) found in the administrator\
application.

## Complaint Selection

The guide cards for the selected call type are listed in the chief\
complaint question drop down that is configured in the [UniversalQuestions Editor](<General Questions Editor.md>).  Prior to selecting\
a complaint, the subsequent tabs of the active call window are blank.&#x20;\
The complaint selection determines the information that populates these\
tabs.  To move past the primary questions to the [KeyQuestions](<Vital Points.md>) or another tab, a complaint selection\
must be made.

## Remote Operation

With a CAD system having an interface to Premier Responder,\
notifications are sent when an entry is made.  Notifications include a\
narrative that can be configured using the settings on the [UniversalQuestions Narrative Settings configurationscreen](<General Questions Narrative Settings.md>).  Additionally,\
the complaint may be set remotely by CAD.

## Required Entries

By default, question entries are optional.  To make an entry required,\
check the **Mandatory** check box found on the **Question** properties\
screen of the [Universal QuestionsEditor](<General Questions Editor.md>).  Optionally, the font style\
or color can be changed as an indication that an entry is required.

  **Key Questions**
  -------------------

# Key Questions Tab

The **Key Questions** are the criteria used to determine the [dispatchpriority](Priorities.md).  They are located on the **Key Questions**
tab and are associated with the [selectedcomplaint](General Questions.md).  Responses to the key questions are
made by either a yes/no checkbox selection, a drop down list selection,
or a text entry.  Note that the text to the left of the answer box can
also contain hyperlinks.  Selecting a hyperlink performs an action such
as opening a procedure window or changing the complaint selection.  To
change the label or hide the tab use the settings for **Tab #2** on the
[Guide Card Tabs configurationscreen](Guide Card Tabs Settings.md).  The key questions are
entered in the [Key Questions Editor](Vital Point Editor.md) found
in the administrator application.

  **Selecting a Oracle Archive Database**
  -----------------------------------------

# Oracle Server Archive Window

The **Oracle Setup** configuration screen is used to select an Oracle
database for the purpose of archiving calls.  At the top of the screen
are controls used to open a server connection.  Below, the **Cases
Archive** section includes functionality for creating and selecting a
database.  To close the tab without making an archive selection, click
one of the other tabs or the \'X\' toolbar button.

# Connect To Server

The controls at the top of the screen are used to specify a server and
to enter the login information.  Specify the Oracle server by making the
appropriate entries in the **Host**, **Port**, and **Instance** text
boxes.  After specifying the server, enter the **User** and **Password**
for an account having sufficient permissions to create a user, then
select the **Connect** button.

The **Cases Archive** area of the window is initially disabled.  Upon
successfully opening a connection, the **Cases Archive** controls are
enabled and existing archives appear in the **Select** list.  If any of
the connection information is changed, the **Select** list is cleared
and the **Cases Archive** controls are again disabled.

# Creating And Selecting An Archive

The controls in the **Cases Archive** section are used to create a new
database and select an archive.  Once a valid database name has been
entered in the **Name** text box, the **Create** button is enabled. 
Select the **Create** button to create the database.  If successful, the
database is added to the **Select** list.  The archive is then selected
from the databases that appear in the list.

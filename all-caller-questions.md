# All Caller Questions

Universal Questions

On the Universal Questions tab, questions related to the default call type appear.   The Default Call Type setting  is found on the Call-Taking Component configuration screen.  Included in the Universal Question are entries for emergency location, caller name, phone number, and call type.  These can be entered remotely by CAD or manually entered by the call-taker.  CAD is notified via change events when these entries are updated by the call-taker.  A different call type can be made by making a selection from the drop down list of the designated question.  Selecting a different call type from the list loads its associated question set.  The questions appearing on the Universal Questions tab are created using the Universal Questions Editor.

Immediate Dispatch Button

The Immediate Dispatch button is for extremely urgent calls such as unconscious and not breathing.  It is configurable using the settings on Immediate Dispatch Button configuration screen.  If enabled, it appears with the Universal Questions once a location has been entered.  It can be associated with either a Chief Complaint, a Priority or both.  When selected, the associated complaint and priority are automatically set and the appropriate change events sent to CAD.  The button is disabled once a complaint and/or priority has been selected.

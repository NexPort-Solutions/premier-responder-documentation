  **Dispatcher Actions**
  ------------------------

The **Dispatcher Actions** tab contains instructions for the dispatcher
that is associated with the specific emergency selected in the
[Universal Questions](General%20Questions.htm).  There are no entries to
be made by the call-taker on the **Dispatcher Actions** tab.  To change
the label or hide the tab use the settings for **Tab #6** on the [Guide
Card Tabs configuration screen](Guide%20Card%20Tabs%20Settings.htm). 
Dispatcher actions are entered using the [Guide Card
Editor](Guide%20Card%20Editor.htm).

# Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can appear in the dispatcher actions and are indicated by a
blue underlined font.  The mouse cursor is seen as a hand with the index
finger pointing upward when hovering over a link  When clicked on, a
link performs an action such as opening a scripted procedure window or
changing the chief complaint.  Once clicked on, links appear with a
blue, bold, underlined font.

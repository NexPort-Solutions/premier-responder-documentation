  **Premier Responder Introduction**
  ------------------------------------

Premier Responder is a Windows™ software application that is used to
assist a Call Receiving Operator (CRO) through the process of handling
an emergency call.  Using customized medical guide card information
prepared by and the local Medical Director, Premier Responder enables
the call receiving operator to make informed decisions as to what units
to dispatch to the scene of an emergency while also providing
pre-arrival instructions to assist the caller until emergency responders
arrive.

Premier Responder can be configured to store the information gathered
over the course of a call either locally or to a common archive located
on a shared network drive.  The ability then exists to browse through
the data in the archive and print reports on individual cases or export
selected cases to Microsoft Excel so that collective reports can be
generated.

Included within Premier Responder are online references for hazardous
materials, terms & abbreviations, and medical instructions.  These are
accessible to the CRO through menu items on the active call window.

Finally, Premier Responder allows an agency the opportunity to further
customize the software by providing the means to:

-   Create guide card sets for other call types
-   Enter terms & abbreviations, standard operating procedures, and
    contacts
-   Enable optional features through configuration settings

  -------------------

At any time after a case has been started, the case can be ended by one
of the following:

-   Press the red **End** button
-   Press the **F6** shortcut key
-   From a CAD system having interface to Premier Responder

When the call is ended, the call taker window closes and the Premier
Responder Calltaker main form displays. The newly ended call has been
added to the bottom of the Recent Calls table, and if desired, the case
can be reviewed immediately.

# Viewing a Report

The **Report** window is used to view the case report or the [short
report](Short%20Report.htm) of a previously entered call.  To open the
**Case Report** window, select a call in the **Recent Calls** table then
either the **View** button, the **Case - View Call** menu item, or the
**F3** key.  The **Report** window opens with the **Case Report** tab
selected.  A condensed report is seen on the **Short Report** tab.  To
resize the window, drag the lower right corner.  The **Print** toolbar
button prints the content of the selected tab.

### **Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG)**

The ERG window is a computer based version of the Department of\
Transportation's Emergency Response Guidebook.  It is accessed from the\
active call window by selecting the ERG button.  Accessible from the ERG\
form are 62 individual guides containing safety recommendations and\
emergency response information for over 3500 chemical substances.  Each\
guide is designed to cover a group of materials which possess similar\
chemical and toxicological characteristics.  The guide information is\
organized into Potential Hazards, Public Safety and Emergency Response\
sections.

Note that the database utilized by the tabs described above does not\
reproduce the Emergency Response Guidebook as it appears in its full\
printed format. The data does contain all the information presented in\
the Material Name (yellow and blue pages), Guides (orange pages), and\
Isolation/Protective (green pages) sections.

Finally, operator activity within the ERG window, including a time stamp\
for each action, is recoded in the Events section of the [casereport](<Case Reports.md>).  Additionally, a narrative message to a CAD\
system that occurs upon selection of a material, guide or placard can be\
configured on the [SOP/ERG Narrative configurationscreen](<SOP-ERG Narrative Settings.md>) within the Administrator\
application.

### **Case Reports**

## Opening a Report

The **Case Report** tab is opened from the Premier Responder Supervisor\
window [**QA Cases** tab](<Case Review.md>).  On the **Case Report**\
tab, the formatted case report appears in a text box with limited\
editing functionality.  This is for review and evaluation purposes.&#x20;\
Selecting the **Grade** toolbar button opens the [**Grade Call**tab](<Case Eval.md>) which is used to QA the call.  The **Recordings**\
toolbar button is used to open the [CallRecordings](<Call Recordings.md>) tab, which requires the VPI Empower\

menu item or the **X** toolbar button.

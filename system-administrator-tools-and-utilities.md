| Evaluation Techniques |
| --------------------- |

Evaluation of employee performance and behavior is seen as a "necessary evil." Employees generally do not like the process, and supervisors see it as something that has to be done once a year.

With this system, the employee is evaluated in an objective manner using standardized evaluation guidelines every month or every quarter. These evaluations reflect the employee's performance and behavior for the month or quarter, and not only document poor performance and behavior, but also highlight acceptable and exceptional performance and behavior.

As a performance feedback device, monthly or bimonthly evaluations can work wonders for positive employee morale. Timely recognition of tasks done well motivates employees to try harder. Although it may seem hard to believe, employees who are provided timely feedback on unacceptable or marginal performance or behavior will react positively, trying to improve for the next evaluation.

Supervisors are guided through the evaluation process with all criteria for evaluation guidelines shown on the screen. Comments are easily added to illustrate the rating given the employee in each category. The criteria for each position is provided in writing to the employee when he or she enters the position, so the employee knows not only what will be evaluated, but also what degree of performance he or she must attain.

This program provides a number of categories generic to most jobs. These include personal appearance, knowledge and application of policies and procedures, and relationships with others. You as the Program Coordinator must customize the employee's evaluation criteria to the individual position that is to be evaluated. This personalizes the evaluation to that person, and further validates the evaluation process.

How do you customize these evaluation criteria? First, you have to understand how the criteria work . . . then you can begin to design criteria from individual job descriptions.

| Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation |
| -------------------------------------- |

These guidelines are designed to give the trainer/supervisor specific guidelines by which to objectively evaluate behavior and performance. These guidelines ensure the trainer's/supervisor's evaluation tool is considered valid and reliable.

If you take into consideration the default rating categories supplied in the software, each is divided into three segments of observable behavior or performance. The rating of "1' denotes the worst possible behavior or performance that can be expected for that category. A rating of "4" denotes behavior or performance that is acceptable, but the lowest level of behavior or performance that is considered acceptable. A rating of "7" indicates the highest level of performance that can be expected for the category.

The Seven-Point Scale defines three levels (1, 4, and 7) while leaving four other points on the scale (2, 3, 5, and 6) to allow the evaluator some latitude in grading. If behavior or performance is slightly better than a "1," the rating should be a "2." If behavior or performance is slightly less than a "4," the rating should be a "3." If behavior or performance is slightly better than a "4," the rating should be a "5." If behavior or performance is slightly less than a "7," the rating should be a "6."

The important factor that must be considered when using the Seven - Point Scale is that different evaluators are able to uniformly recognize and evaluate unacceptable behavior and performance as well as acceptable behavior and performance. For example two different supervisors may observe the same behavior or performance. They may disagree as to whether what they each observed should be graded as a "2" or a "3," but they agree that the behavior or performance is unacceptable. Similarly, if they disagree as to whether the observed behavior or performance is a "4" or a "5," they do agree that the employee is acceptable in that category.

The "4" rating described in the Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation should clearly define the line between "acceptable" and "unacceptable." If two different supervisors watch performance that one rates as a "3" while the other rates as a "5," there is a problem. While there may be different gradients on the scale, it is most important that all evaluators see behavior and performance as definitely "acceptable or "unacceptable." Where the rating lies within these ranges is not as important as it is to uniformly recognize acceptable vs. unacceptable behavior.

To ensure ratings are consistent from day to day and from supervisor to supervisor, the Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation must be used every time an evaluation is prepared. Consistency and objectivity are enhanced when the guidelines are directly used while preparing an evaluation. If there is a dispute or question with an employee over a rating in a certain category, the values defined in the guidelines should show whether the rating matches observed behavior or performance. That is why the software displays the evaluation guidelines for each category right on the screen.

Employees are to be provided with a copy of the Standardized Guidelines for Evaluation that pertains to their job in advance of the actual evaluation. Employees cannot be expected to meet and/or exceed defined standards without knowing what those standards are. New employees should be issued a copy of the guidelines during the first few days of employment, during the orientation phase. They should also be familiarized with the employee evaluation system and its use.

| Writing your own Evaluation Criteria |
| ------------------------------------ |

The software provides generic categories for evaluation, but you will have to create evaluation criteria to match items on the job description. This personalizes the evaluation and helps give the employee specific feedback on particular job tasks.

To write these criteria, obtain a copy of the job description and look at the items found there. From these items, determine which should be evaluated. Write down each of these items on a separate sheet, leaving a three to five inch space under each.

Under each item, write a title for the criteria. For example, if the job description says, "Prepare correspondence within the department," the title for this category would be "Prepare Correspondence". Then describe the behavior and/or performance that is to be rated in this category, such as, "Evaluates the employee's ability to prepare correspondence for use within the department, according to agency guidelines, policies and procedures."

Next, write "4", and describe the performance and/or behavior that would represent the Minimal level of acceptable performance. Using our example, this statement might be "Prepares correspondence for use within the department on the proper forms, are generally neat and clean with proper grammar, punctuation and/or spelling, according to policies and procedures." This description then equates to the minimum acceptable performance under this category.

Now write a number "1" on the page, and describe the worst possible behavior and/or performance for this category. This may be, "Employee refuses to or cannot prepare correspondence according to policy and procedure. Correspondence has numerous grammar, punctuation and/or spelling errors. Documents have an unprofessional appearance." This describes the worst possible performance and/or behavior that the employee could display. It represents the "bottom of the barrel."

Now write a number "7" on the page and describe the best possible behavior and/or performance for this category. This may be, "Employee quickly and efficiently prepares departmental correspondence according to policy and procedure. Correspondence is completely free of grammar, punctuation and spelling errors. Documents have an extremely professional appearance." This describes the best possible performance and/or behavior that the employee could display. It marks the best of the best.

Your page should look like this:

Prepare Correspondence Evaluates the employee's ability to prepare correspondence for use within the department, according to agency guidelines, policies and procedures.

1Employee refuses to or cannot prepare correspondence according to policy

and procedure. Correspondence has numerous grammar, punctuation and/

or spelling errors. Documents have an unprofessional appearance.

4Prepares correspondence for use within the department on the proper forms,

are generally neat and clean with proper grammar, punctuation and/or spelling,

according to policies and procedures.

7Employee quickly and efficiently prepares departmental correspondence

according to policy and procedure. Correspondence is completely free of

grammar, punctuation and spelling errors. Documents have an extremely

professional appearance.

Congratulations! You have now created the 1-4-7 evaluation criteria for an evaluation category.

Do this for each of the items that you find on the job description. Massage them to be consistent and objective. Then go to the administration section of the software and enter the information in a customized criteria set. (See the section on the manual on editing criteria.)

Print the criteria set and distribute it to the employee before beginning the evaluation process.

| Evaluation Frequency |
| -------------------- |

Employees should be evaluated regularly. The software was designed for use in a periodic system, such as monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly.

To compensate for a "bad month" or two, more evaluations are favored over fewer evaluations. Monthly evaluations are suggested, with bimonthly next in line. While the software can be used for quarterly evaluations, this scheme only produces four evaluation periods - not enough to include all of the good things that the employee does.

More frequent evaluations are better. Once the supervisor/evaluator gets used to the software, completing an evaluation will take about ten minutes.

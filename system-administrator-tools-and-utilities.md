# System Administrator Tools and Utilities

The **System Administrator Tools and Utilities** area in **Premier Responder Administrator** provides database-level and maintenance workflows used by technical administrators.

## What this page covers

This page summarizes where to find common system-level tasks and when to use them.

Tasks typically include:

* Installing software updates and data-file updates.
* Managing archived call data.
* Maintaining user and reference-data configuration.
* Validating environment-specific settings after maintenance changes.

## Open the tools area

1. Log in to **Premier Responder Administrator** with an account that has system-management rights.
2. Use the top-level Administrator menus to open the tool needed for your task.
3. Complete the task-specific workflow in the linked page.

## Common tasks and where to go

### Install updates

Use these pages when applying product or dataset changes:

* [Installing Updates](<Installing Updates.md>)
* [Installing Software Updates](<Installing Software Updates.md>)
* [Installing Data File Updates](<Installing Data File Updates.md>)

### Manage archived calls

Use these pages when working with call-history storage and retrieval:

* [Archiving Calls](<Archiving Calls.md>)
* [Case Archive](<Case Archive.md>)
* [Case Archive Access](<Case Archive Access.md>)
* [Case Archive SQL](<Case Archive SQL.md>)

### Configure core administrator data

## Operational guidance

> Warning
> Perform system-level changes in a planned maintenance window and verify expected behavior before returning the system to production use.

After completing any system-level change:

1. Confirm Administrator pages load without errors.
2. Confirm call-taking workflows still open expected guide-card content.
3. Confirm archive/reporting workflows still return expected results.

Now write a number "7" on the page and describe the best possible behavior and/or performance for this category. This may be, "Employee quickly and efficiently prepares departmental correspondence according to policy and procedure. Correspondence is completely free of grammar, punctuation and spelling errors. Documents have an extremely professional appearance." This describes the best possible performance and/or behavior that the employee could display. It marks the best of the best.

Your page should look like this:

Prepare Correspondence Evaluates the employee's ability to prepare correspondence for use within the department, according to agency guidelines, policies and procedures.

1Employee refuses to or cannot prepare correspondence according to policy

and procedure. Correspondence has numerous grammar, punctuation and/

or spelling errors. Documents have an unprofessional appearance.

4Prepares correspondence for use within the department on the proper forms,

are generally neat and clean with proper grammar, punctuation and/or spelling,

according to policies and procedures.

7Employee quickly and efficiently prepares departmental correspondence

according to policy and procedure. Correspondence is completely free of

grammar, punctuation and spelling errors. Documents have an extremely

professional appearance.

Congratulations! You have now created the 1-4-7 evaluation criteria for an evaluation category.

Do this for each of the items that you find on the job description. Massage them to be consistent and objective. Then go to the administration section of the software and enter the information in a customized criteria set. (See the section on the manual on editing criteria.)

Print the criteria set and distribute it to the employee before beginning the evaluation process.

| Evaluation Frequency |
| -------------------- |

Employees should be evaluated regularly. The software was designed for use in a periodic system, such as monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly.

To compensate for a "bad month" or two, more evaluations are favored over fewer evaluations. Monthly evaluations are suggested, with bimonthly next in line. While the software can be used for quarterly evaluations, this scheme only produces four evaluation periods - not enough to include all of the good things that the employee does.

More frequent evaluations are better. Once the supervisor/evaluator gets used to the software, completing an evaluation will take about ten minutes.

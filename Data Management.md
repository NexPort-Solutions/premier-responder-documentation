### **Data Management**

## Premier Responder Application Database

Guide card content is stored in the Premier Responder application\
database, in addition to user logins, contacts, [standard operatingprocedures](911Adviser%20Acronyms.md), HAZMAT response guides, and\
configuration settings.  The Premier Responder application database\
consists of several Access data files which reside on the local PC and\
are installed separately from the software.

## Content Editors

Various editing utilities are provided to update the guide cards and\
other content as needed.  An [administrator login](<User Manager.md>)\
is required to access the editors.  Editing is disabled for the medical\
guide card content since changes require the approval the local medical\
director.  The following editors are provided:

* [User Manager](<User Manager.md>)
* [Contacts Editor](<Contacts Editor.md>)
* [Guide Card Editor](<Guide Card Editor.md>)
* [Key Questions Editor](<Vital Point Editor.md>)

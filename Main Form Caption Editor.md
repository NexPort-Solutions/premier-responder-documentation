  **Window Caption Editor Controls**
  ------------------------------------

The **Window Caption** editor controls are used to construct the title
bar caption of the Premier Responder active call window.  Any
combination of the [All Caller Questions](All%20Caller%20Questions.htm)
or [General Questions](General%20Questions.htm) together with the
associated responses may be displayed.

To access the Window Caption Editor Controls:

-   [Log into Premier Responder Administrator](Logging%20In.htm)
-   Open the [Call Type Editor](Available%20Call%20Types%20Editor.htm)
    by selecting Edit - Call Types menu item on the main form.
-   Select a call type from the list to enable the Window Caption editor
    controls.

The configured caption, seen in the Window Caption text box, [appears on
the active call window title bar](General%20Questions.htm).  When taking
a call, the values entered into the caption questions are updated on the
title bar.

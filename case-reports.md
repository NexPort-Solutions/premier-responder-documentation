# Case Reports

Opening a Report

The Case Report tab is opened from the Premier Responder Supervisor window QA Cases tab.  On the Case Report tab, the formatted case report appears in a text box with limited editing functionality.  This is for review and evaluation purposes.  Selecting the Grade toolbar button opens the Grade Call tab which is used to QA the call.  The Recordings toolbar button is used to open the Call Recordings tab, which requires the VPI Empower communications recording and quality improvement software.  To close the Case Report tab and return to the QA Cases tab, select the Case Report tab File - Close menu item or the X toolbar button.

Report Sections

At the top of the report is the header.  It includes entries for the Case Number, Dispatcher, Call Time, and Call Length.  The Dispatch Time and Call Score can be included with the Include Time To Dispatch and Include Call Score settings on the CAD Interface configuration screen, but are omitted by default.  These settings do not affect the contents of existing reports.  Following the report header are sections containing entries for the General Questions and Vital Points.  If there are SOP remarks, they appear after the Vital Points section.  Last in the report is the Events section, showing each call-taker action together with an associated time stamp.

Adding Comments to a Report

Comments can be added to the case report, either at the end of a line or between lines.  To add a comment, position the cursor appropriately and enter the desired text.  Note that the original report content and previously saved comments cannot be altered.  Comments show up in red in order to stand out.

Saving and Hiding Comments in Report

For case reports with comments, the Comments - Hide menu item is enabled.  Use the Comments - Hide menu item to hide comments.  With comments hidden, the Comments - View menu item is enabled and the Comments - Hide menu item is disabled.  To reveal hidden comments, select the Comments - View menu item.

Selecting the Comments - Save menu item saves the case report.  Note with comments hidden the Comments - Save menu item is disabled.  Also note that saved comments are permanent.  Before saving, be sure comments have been correctly entered and are not hidden.

Saving a Report to a File

Use the File - Save menu item on the Case Report tab toolbar to save the case report to a rich text file.  Selecting File - Save opens the standard Save As dialog window.  To save the report, browse to the desired folder, enter a file name and select the Save button.  Note with comments hidden that the saved document will not include comments.

Printing a Report

To print the case report, select the File - Print menu item on the Case Report tab toolbar.  This opens the standard Print dialog window with All being the only enabled option in the Print range.  On the Print dialog window, specify the desired printer and number of copies then select the OK button to print the entire report. Note with comments hidden that the printed document will not include comments.

  **Standard Operating Procedure**
  ----------------------------------

Upon selecting a complaint on the [Universal
Questions](General%20Questions.htm) tab of the active call window,
asterisks will be seen on either side of the SOP tab label when there is
a related standard operating procedure.  Note that the procedure is
automatically loaded with the title showing in the **Standard Operating
Procedures** combo box and the first step in the text box beneath.

To navigate through the steps use the **Prev** and **Next** buttons. 
The action taken is entered in the **Remarks** text box with a time
stamp on selecting the **Completed** or **Not Applicable** buttons. 
Completed and skipped narratives to a CAD system can be configured on
the [SOP/ERG Narrative configuration
screen](SOP-ERG%20Narrative%20Settings.htm).  SOP remarks also appear in
the [case report](Case%20Reports.htm).

Note that the SOP tab is configurable in that the label can be edited or
the tab hidden with the **Tab #9** settings seen on the [Guide Card Tabs
configuration screen](Guide%20Card%20Tabs%20Settings.htm).  Standard
operating procedures content is entered by an administrator level user
in the [Standard Operating Procedures
Editor](Standard%20Operating%20Procedures%20Editor.htm).
